## What Is This Project About

This project is a **landing page clone of the ToDesktop website**, built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and a bit of JavaScript**. It is part of my **[Self-Driven MERN Stack Internship](https://github.com/iammihirsig/Self-Driven-MERN-Stack-Internship)**.

> 💡 _The goal was to test and implement concepts I learned in Tailwind through a real-world, industry-level layout. This marks a milestone in my ability to design and build UI like a professional frontend developer._

## Final Note

> 🌱 This project helped me **grow from a learner to a builder**.

From managing a GitHub repository, to building and deploying a fully functional UI, and learning how to show up daily — it has taught me way more than just writing HTML and CSS.

> 🧠 It’s not just about _how to code_, but about _how to think and work like a developer._
